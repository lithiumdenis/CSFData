Since the first dinosaur fossils were recognized
in the early 19th century, mounted fossil dinosaur skeletons
have been major attractions at museums around the world, and
dinosaurs have become an enduring part of world culture. The
large sizes of some groups, as well as their seemingly monstrous
and fantastic nature, have ensured dinosaurs' regular appearance
in best-selling books and films, such as Jurassic Park.
Persistent public enthusiasm for the animals has resulted
in significant funding for dinosaur science, and new discoveries
are regularly covered by the media.
